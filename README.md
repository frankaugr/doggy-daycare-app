### 3. Setting Up Cloud Backup

Protect your data with automatic cloud backups:

### Compliance Monitoring

The **Compliance Status** tab automatically tracks:

Use the email and WhatsApp buttons to quickly send reminders to owners.

## ⚙️ Settings Guide

### WhatsApp Templates

Set up quick WhatsApp messages with the same placeholder system. Make sure to include your country code in the business phone number (e.g., `+1234567890`).

### Cloud Backup Configuration

## 💾 Data Management

### Manual Backup/Restore

In the **Dog Management** tab:
- **Export Data**: Download a JSON backup of all your data
- **Import Data**: Restore from a previously exported backup file

### Data Location

Your data is stored locally at:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\doggy-daycare\data.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/doggy-daycare/data.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/doggy-daycare/data.json`

During development, data is stored in the project folder as `doggy-daycare-dev-data/data.json`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Cloud Backup Issues

**"Cloud directory does not exist" error:**
- Ensure the folder path exists and is accessible
- Check that your cloud storage app is running and synced
- Verify the path format matches your operating system

**Backups not syncing:**
- Check your internet connection status
- Verify the cloud directory has write permissions
- Try clicking the manual sync button in the connection status panel

### Data Recovery

If you need to restore your data:
1. Go to **Dog Management** → **Import Data**
2. Select your backup file (either manual export or cloud backup)
3. Confirm the import - this will replace all current data

### Performance Issues

- Cloud backups run in the background and shouldn't affect app performance
- If experiencing slowdowns, try increasing the sync interval in settings
- Check that your cloud storage isn't consuming excessive system resources
