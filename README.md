### 2. Adding Your First Dog

Navigate to the **Dog Management** tab and click **Add New Dog**:

**Required Information:**
- Dog Name
- Owner Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address

**Optional Information:**
- Breed
- Age
- Vaccination Date (important for compliance tracking)

Click **Add Dog** to save.

### 3. Setting Up Cloud Backup

Protect your data with automatic cloud backups:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Cloud Backup Settings**
2. Check **"Enable automatic cloud backups"**
3. Set your **Cloud Directory Path**:
   - **Dropbox**: `/Users/YourName/Dropbox/DoggyDaycare/`
   - **Google Drive**: `/Users/YourName/Google Drive/DoggyDaycare/`
   - **OneDrive**: `/Users/YourName/OneDrive/DoggyDaycare/`
4. Configure backup settings:
   - **Maximum Backup Files**: How many backups to keep (default: 100)
   - **Auto-Sync Interval**: How often to backup when online (default: 30 minutes)
5. Click **Save Settings**

The app will automatically create timestamped backup files like:
```
doggy-daycare-backup-2024-01-15T14-30-45-123Z.json
```

### 4. Understanding the Connection Status

Look for the connection indicator in the top-right corner:

- 🟢 **Online** - Connected to internet, ready to sync
- 🔵 **Syncing** - Currently backing up data
- ✅ **Synced** - Backup completed successfully
- ⚠️ **Error** - Backup failed (check your cloud directory path)
- ⚫ **Offline** - No internet connection

Click the status indicator to see details and manually trigger a sync.

## 📋 Daily Operations

### Managing Daily Attendance

1. Go to **Daily Checklist** tab
2. Select dogs attending today using the checkboxes
3. For each attending dog, track:
   - **Behavioral checklist** (Eating well, Playing, etc.)
   - **Drop-off and pick-up times**
   - **Feeding schedule**
   - **Special notes**

### Compliance Monitoring

The **Compliance Status** tab automatically tracks:
- Dogs with missing consent forms (overdue monthly signatures)
- Dogs with expired or expiring vaccinations
- Overall compliance statistics

Use the email and WhatsApp buttons to quickly send reminders to owners.

## ⚙️ Settings Guide

### Email Templates

Customize your communication templates with placeholders:

**Available Variables:**
- `{dogName}` - The dog's name
- `{ownerName}` - Owner's name
- `{ownerEmail}` - Owner's email
- `{currentDate}` - Today's date
- `{vaccineType}` - Type of vaccination (vaccine reminders only)
- `{expirationDate}` - Vaccination expiry date (vaccine reminders only)

### WhatsApp Templates

Set up quick WhatsApp messages with the same placeholder system. Make sure to include your country code in the business phone number (e.g., `+1234567890`).

### Cloud Backup Configuration

- **Enable automatic cloud backups**: Turn on/off the backup feature
- **Cloud Directory Path**: Full path to your cloud-synced folder
- **Maximum Backup Files**: Older backups are automatically deleted when this limit is reached
- **Auto-Sync Interval**: How frequently to backup when online (5-480 minutes)

## 💾 Data Management

### Manual Backup/Restore

In the **Dog Management** tab:
- **Export Data**: Download a JSON backup of all your data
- **Import Data**: Restore from a previously exported backup file

### Data Location

Your data is stored locally at:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\doggy-daycare\data.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/doggy-daycare/data.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/doggy-daycare/data.json`

During development, data is stored in the project folder as `doggy-daycare-dev-data/data.json`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Cloud Backup Issues

**"Cloud directory does not exist" error:**
- Ensure the folder path exists and is accessible
- Check that your cloud storage app is running and synced
- Verify the path format matches your operating system

**Backups not syncing:**
- Check your internet connection status
- Verify the cloud directory has write permissions
- Try clicking the manual sync button in the connection status panel

### Data Recovery

If you need to restore your data:
1. Go to **Dog Management** → **Import Data**
2. Select your backup file (either manual export or cloud backup)
3. Confirm the import - this will replace all current data

### Performance Issues

- Cloud backups run in the background and shouldn't affect app performance
- If experiencing slowdowns, try increasing the sync interval in settings
- Check that your cloud storage isn't consuming excessive system resources

## 🛠️ Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/frankaugr/doggy-daycare-app.git
cd doggy-daycare-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Rust 1.70+
- Platform-specific dependencies for Tauri

### iOS Simulator Setup

1. Install Xcode (with Command Line Tools) from the Mac App Store and launch it once to accept the license.
2. Install the Rust toolchain targets required by Tauri:
   ```bash
   rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim aarch64-apple-ios
   ```
3. Install npm dependencies and the Tauri CLI if you have not already:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install --global @tauri-apps/cli
   ```
4. Generate the iOS project scaffolding (creates `src-tauri/gen/apple` and an Xcode workspace):
   ```bash
   npm run ios:init
   ```
5. Launch the generated workspace in Xcode and pick the desired simulator:
   ```bash
   npm run ios:open
   ```
6. To iterate quickly with hot reload, run the iOS development server which will build the Rust side and attach to the selected simulator:
   ```bash
   npm run ios:dev
   ```
   If you want to drive the run from within Xcode, start the same command with the `--open` flag and keep that terminal tab running before pressing **Run** in Xcode:
   ```bash
   npm run ios:dev -- --open
   ```
   (This seeds the Tauri dev server so the generated `Build Rust Code` phase can locate the simulator bridge file. Without it Xcode will report `failed to read missing addr file ...app-server-addr`.)

7. When you tweak any settings inside `src-tauri/gen/apple/project.yml`, regenerate the workspace with:
   ```bash
   npm run ios:xcodegen
   ```

The `ios:build` script (`npm run ios:build`) produces a signed `.app` or `.ipa` when you are ready to distribute to devices. For simulator testing you can rely on `ios:dev` or run the build directly inside Xcode after selecting an iPhone or iPad simulator target.
